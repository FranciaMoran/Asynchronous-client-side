# Pet Maps!

Pet Maps is an asynchronous-client-side app which provides the user with a map of adoptable pets near them. The inspiration for this project came about with the realization that a comparable app with available pets closest to a geographical location with a visual map did not exist. Therefore, the idea for the Pet Maps app was conceived. 

The Pet Maps app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, the google maps api, and the petfinder api to deliver to the user functionality and a clear design.
